### Great_Expectations
### Description
Great Expectations is a shared, open standard for data quality. 
It helps data teams eliminate pipeline debt, through data testing, documentation, and profiling.
### General informations
Great Expectations helps teams save time and promote analytic integrity by offering a unique approach to automated testing: pipeline tests. 
Pipeline tests are applied to data (instead of code) and at batch time (instead of compile or deploy time).
Pipeline tests are like unit tests for datasets: they help you guard against upstream data changes and monitor data quality.

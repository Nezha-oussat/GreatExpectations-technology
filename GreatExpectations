### Description
==============================
Great Expectations is a shared, open standard for data quality. 
It helps data teams eliminate pipeline debt, through data testing, documentation, and profiling.
### General informations
==============================
Great Expectations helps teams save time and promote analytic integrity by offering a unique approach to automated testing: pipeline tests. 
Pipeline tests are applied to data (instead of code) and at batch time (instead of compile or deploy time).
Pipeline tests are like unit tests for datasets: they help you guard against upstream data changes and monitor data quality.
the website of great expectations technology is https://greatexpectations.io/case-studies/
Great Expectations has 4 repositories available such as https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations
*Great Expectations is both a community and an open source project.
-The community is an inclusive space for data practitioners who want to improve data collaboration, with data quality as an integral component of that discussion.
-The project provides a shared, open standard for data quality, expressed in software.
-They strive for positive impact for individuals, for teams and companies, and for the whole data ecosystem.
to learn more about this technology the community had a youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/c/GreatExpectationsData/videos
this technology is under active development by James Campbell, Abe Gong, Eugene Mandel, Rob Lim, Taylor Miller, with help from many others.
Abe Gong is a core contributor to the Great Expectations open source library, and CEO and Co-founder at Superconductive.  Prior to Superconductive, 
Abe was Chief Data Officer at Aspire Health, the founding member of the Jawbone data science team, and lead data scientist at Massive Health.
### Main capabilities
==============================
With Great Expectations, you can assert what you expect from the data you load and transform, and catch data issues quickly 
â€“ Expectations are basically unit tests for your data.
Not only that, but Great Expectations also creates data documentation and data quality reports from those Expectations.
*Data science and data engineering teams use Great Expectations to:
-Test data they ingest from other teams or vendors and ensure its validity. 
-Validate data they transform as a step in their data pipeline in order to ensure the correctness of transformations.
-Prevent data quality issues from slipping into data products.
